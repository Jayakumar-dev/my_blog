## Let's break down its architecture:

## Virtual Machines (VMs):
- 🛡️ Full Isolation: Each VM has its own OS, offering strong isolation but with more overhead.
- 🐢 Slower Start-up: Booting a full OS takes time.
- 🏋️‍♂️ Resource Heavy: Requires significant resources for OS and hardware virtualization.
- 🏛️ Use Case: Great for running different OS types and legacy applications.

## Containers:
- 🌐 Shared OS: Containers share the host OS kernel, making them lightweight.
- ⚡ Fast Deployment: Spin up almost instantly.
- 🔋 Efficient: Better resource usage, ideal for running multiple apps.
- 🎯 Use Case: Perfect for microservices and cloud-native applications.

## Key Takeaway:
- Choose VMs when you need isolation and compatibility across different OS environments.
- Opt for Containers when you need speed, portability, and efficiency.
